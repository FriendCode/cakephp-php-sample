[![Code Now](https://friendco.de/widgets/image/codenow?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFriendCode%2Fcakephp-php-sample.git)](https://friendco.de/widgets/url/codenow?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFriendCode%2Fcakephp-php-sample.git)


A complete sample application in PHP using CakePHP which 
can run on FriendCode and Heroku.

## Important
 * Requires a **index.php** to run on **FriendCode** and **Heroku**
 * FriendCode's runtime is in many ways similar to (and compatible with) Heroku's, so be aware of that


Happy coding !
